# stacked_pages_x
Sample APP - Qt 5.7+ - Android iOS

[AUTHOR ( ekke )](AUTHOR.md)

This app is part of ekke's blog series about mobile x-platform development:
http://j.mp/qt-x

This is not a real-live app - this app demonstrates the use of Material style and new Qt Quick Controls 2

This app is a follow-up to http://j.mp/qt-one-page-x - please read this blog and explore the first app before following here

The topics of this second sample app:

* more Qt Quick Controls 2 stuff: Buttons (Raised Buttons and Flat Buttons)
* Navigation with StackView: pop(), push(), find()
* go up and down page-by-page or jump back/force
* Navigation with Android bottom Back-key
* navigation with Android Back Button in Titlebar (ToolBar)
* Navigation with Buttons and Floating Action Button
* Management of StackView to implement business-logic - simplified with init() and cleanup() functions
* Dark Theme and selecting primary and accent color from options menu in ToolBar

Strings are marked as translatable, but not translated. See the first app to learn about i18n

This second sample app is a simple app only to demonstrate navigation through stacked pages

This app needs Qt 5.7 Beta and will be updated as soon as Qt 5.7 RC is out with different namespace for Qt QUick Controls 2 (qt.labs.controls)
